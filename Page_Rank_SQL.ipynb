    "# Homework - Graph analysis with SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework, we will leverage SQL to analyze a graph dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Two common tasks in analyzing a graph are\n",
    "* finding connected components \n",
    "* computing PageRank\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part of this homework, your task is to write an SQL function that finds connected components of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second part of this homework, your task is to write an SQL function to compute the PageRank of each of the nodes of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Grading**\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework is worth 100 points. Each task is worth 50 points. Within each task, the point breakdown is\n",
    "\n",
    "* 35 points - Implementation and execution\n",
    "* 10 points - Test cases. Design a very small (less than 10 nodes) but comprehensive graph, hand-calculate the expected output, run your implemented functions on your test graph and verify the correctness of your function by comparing the result with your expected output. \n",
    "* 5 points - Comments. Write comments that help both you and the grader understand what you are doing and why\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "**Turnin**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you're done with your solution, hit \"Submit\" button on the top right menue, and your solution notebook will be recorded for grading. You can hit submit unlimited number of times. Your last submission will always be recorded for grading. \n",
    "\n",
    "**A note on speed**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very important that you try to do as much as possible declaratively.  Looping through the contents of a table using a cursor is necessarily going to be slow.  You should try to do as much as is possible using declarative SQL queries.  Use loops and conditionals to guide the overall control flow, only when there's clearly no way to do what you want using declarative SQL. On this assignment, there's often a **100$\\times$** or more difference in performance between a well-written code that is mostly using declarative queries, and one written with a lot of loops. Not to mention that declarative queries are easier to code and debug!\n",
    "\n",
    "For your reference, our solution for task 1 runs for about 2-3 minutes, and for task 2 runs for about 1-2 minutes. "

    "\n",
    "PageRank is a standard graph metric that is well-known as the basis for Google's original search engine.  The idea behind PageRank is simple: we want a metric that rewards web pages (or in our case, papers) that are often pointed to by other pages (or in our case, often cited by other papers). The more popular the page, the greater the PageRank.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this, PageRank models a web surfer, starting at a random page, and randomly clicking links. There is a probability $d$ that the surfer follows a link from the current page, a probability $1 - d$ that the surfer jumps to a random page. $d$ is called the **damping factor**. A standard value for $d$ is 0.85 (everyone should use this value in this homework to expect the same result). Given this setup, the so-called **PageRank** of a web page (or a paper) is the probability that when the user stops clicking (or following references), s/he will land on that page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since so-called **sinks** (those pages that don't link anywhere else) would accumulate all of this probability under the simplest model, it is assumed that those pages with no out-links instead link with equal probability to everyone else.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to compute the PageRank of every page (or node) in a dataset.  The simplest is an iterative\n",

    "Then, at iteration $i$, we simply set:\n",
    "$$PR_i (\\textrm{paper}_j) = \\frac{1 - d}{n} + d \\left( \\sum_{k \\in \\{\\textrm{papers citing paper}_j\\}} \n",
    "\t\\frac{PR_{i - 1}(\\textrm{paper}_k)}{\\textrm{num papers cited by paper}_k} \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
